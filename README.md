# The Y Standard Library
*By Kenneth Pollick 2022 All Rights Reserved.* [^1]

The Y Standard Library is, as its name implies, the standard library of [the Y Programming Language](https://www.kennethpollick.com/software/y.html), which I've been working on for some years off and on now.
I am currently working on finalizing the standard library and the features of Y together as there are constructs that I definitely want in one of them, so after I complete the standard library, I will be finishing the [Y Compiler and Interpreter (YCI)](https://www.kennethpollick.com/software/yci.html).

To find more information about Y, peruse one of these: [My Personal Site](https://www.kennethpollick.com), [My Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KennethPollick), [The Y Discord](https://discord.gg/AdjxzFjPNs), [My Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kennythelogician), or [My Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE1Lhhv_5oXUv4oiKbmsVnA/videos).

[^1]: Note, I currently have not chosen a license since I haven't looked into the full legal implications of them, but as the standard library will be included in the compiler, you will of course be able to use it.
