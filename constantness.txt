no constants
	-not happening



one constant keyword
	-only at the beginning of variable declarations
		-insufficient
	-extention of the C style use of the const
		-in the correct direction
		-is in kind with the way I think about my type system as an extention of the C style with stuff like C's "int ***" to Y's "integer[4] array[2,4] pointer"
		-constantness then propagates like how abstract types do but on the other side of reference types



two constant keywords
	-one for mere immutability and one for constantness
		-constants are for compiletime and maybe init-time
		-immutable variables are for variables populated at runtime
		-currently looking at both keywords being properties to apply to types in declarations
			-both propagate the same as above
