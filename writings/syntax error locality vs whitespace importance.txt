a simple grammatical change to allow only a few whitespace characters between heads and bodys
	-to keep arbitrary whitespace to a minimum and bodies from being placed in weird places
	-maybe grammatically (in BNF): <hb-pad> := '' | <whitespace> | <whitespace> <newline>
		-where <whitespace> := <space> | <tab> | <newline>
	-maybe not even allow two newlines in a row



stuff this prevents:

natural[] count_tabs(immutable(ascii array[n]) str)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          { /* . . . */ }

list: dt ndt

	append(dt#0 element);
